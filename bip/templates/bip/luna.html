    I have been working as an educational school psychologist for the better part of two decades. 
     I have had the fortune of problem solving  wih the most vulnerable and resilient of 
     our population, including children with various challenges from intellectual, emotional 
     and/or behavioral.  This website was created with my interest in computer programming,
     data analysis, and school psychology.  The goal of this website is to assist practitioners 
    in FBA's that will support data-driven Behavior
    Intervention Plans that is effective and  meaningful.  </h1></p>
