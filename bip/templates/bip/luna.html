            I have been working as an educational school psychologist for the better part of two decades. 
            I have had the fortune of problem-solving with the most vulnerable and resilient of our population, 
            including children with various challenges from intellectual, emotional, and/or behavioral. This website 
            was created with my interest in computer programming, data analysis, and school psychology. The goal of 
            this website is to assist practitioners in developing FBAs that will support data-driven Behavior 
            Intervention Plans that are effective and meaningful.
