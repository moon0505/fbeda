    I have been working as an educational school 
    psychologist for the better part of two decades. 
     I have had the fortune of problem solving  wih the most vulnerable and resilient of 
     our population, including children with various challenges from intellectual, emotional 
     and/or behavioral.  This website was created with my interest in computer programming,
     data analysis, and school psychology.  The goal of this website is to assist practitioners 
    in creating a data-supported FBA that will directly assist in developing a Behavior
    Intervention Plan that is meaningful and substantially supported by data.  </h1></p>
